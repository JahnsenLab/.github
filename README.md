# JahnsenLab Immunology Research

We study how the immune system in the human gut keeps us healthy. How does it defend against dangerous bacteria and viruses and how does it interact with the human microbiota? We also study the role the immune system plays in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Hirschsprungâ€™s disease and graft versus host disease, and how we can harness the immune system to fight colorectal cancer.
